# SparkSQL for Home Sales Data Analysis

This project utilizes SparkSQL in Google Colab to extract key metrics from home sales data. Through Spark, temporary views are created, data is partitioned, and temporary tables are cached and uncached. Additionally, the verification process ensures that the table has been successfully uncached.

The focus of this project is to leverage SparkSQL functionalities in Google Colab for in-depth analysis of home sales data. The process involves:

- **Creating Temporary Views:** Generating temporary views to facilitate SQL-based analysis.
- **Brief Analysis:** Brief look at specific home sales queries, highly reminiscent of sqlite3 draws
- **Partitioning Data:** Optimizing data organization through partitioning.
- **Caching and Uncaching Temporary Tables:** Enhancing performance by caching tables in memory and subsequently uncaching to free up resources.
- **Verification Process:** Confirming the successful uncaching of the tables for efficient memory management.
